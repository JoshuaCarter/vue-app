# Vue App

This is my first Vue app. I'm just testing the waters to see how it compares to React. It uses the same SWAPI api from my sidekicker code test.

---
## Running the App
- Pull the repo down anywhere.
- Run `composer install` on the backend.
- Run `npm install` on the frontend.
- Run `serve_lumen.sh` to serve the PHP backend.
- Run `npm run serve` to serve the Vue frontend.

---
## Building the App
- Run `npm run build` on the frontend (build to `dist` folder).
- Use [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) to serve `dist` folder
